To use disk checker.:

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Filip850/disk-benchmark/refs/heads/main/check-speed.sh | bash
```

if you don't have curl installed... just install it lol :>

Script checks is fio installed - if no - it will install it automaticly. (so it would be better to use sudo with it :>)

### TL;DR - Dev thoughts

Code is open source so u can check that there is no sh*tware - i used it for my master degree thesis.. I needed to make many tests, many times, on many machines and VM's so it was way faster to use sth. like cristal disk - that is  not presented for Linux distro.. so i make this pp :>
